Operation Plan


Introduction
    Team Goals
        As a subteam under the Logistics team, team Warehouse will provide
        a small scale on-site storage facility, pre-stocked with items that
        we expect to come in handy. We support other teams by providing them
        with goods, that their volunteers can pick up at our warehouse. If
        capacity allows, we can also deliver these items to volunteers in the
        field, to minimize the interruption. We will also coordinate shopping
        runs for items that are not yet available, but dearly needed.

        A part of the warehouse will be made available for teams with storage
        requirements that cannot be met by tents. Specifically for the rest of
        team Logistics, we will provide a Headquarters (LHQ), from which the
        subteams can coordinate their activities.

    Organizational graph

    Brief History
        At WTH2005, no preparations were done for a warehouse. During
        build-up, a makeshift warehouse was erected at the attic of a building
        that happened to be available. Pre-event shopping was limited to a box
        of office supplies; essential equipment like tie-wraps and duct tape
        were missing. During build-up, the warehouse was completely self-service
        without any supervision, and it was hard to keep it stocked as we had
        already bought all the duct tape in a 25 km radius. Still though, it
        proved to be a valuable addition to the way the event was built up and
        centralized shopping made sharing of goods easier.

        At HAR2009, the warehouse, now part of team Logistics and named
        Logistics HeadQuarters (LHQ), was prepared in a somewhat more organized
        fashion. However, as a result of opposing views between Logistics and
        the core organization, the warehouse had no housing that was available
        from early build-up until late tear-down, and was moved a total of four
        times. Some of the LHQs were tents, causing boxes to get damp and
        collapse, and metal parts to rust. Despite the energy wasted with
        moving, and things getting lost and broken in the process, we now had a
        warehouse with some supervision, resulting in a much better service
        towards the other teams.

        With OHM2013, LHQ had evolved to a temporary building comprised of
        modular container units. It had shelving and a place to sit down and
        organize the rest of Logistics operations. The more climate proof boxes
        could be locked, and as such became a somewhat more secure storage
        facility. There was enough space to adapt to changing circumstances,
        and its central positioning relative to the rest of the orga field made
        it well-known to all active volunteers. A simple tracking system was
        set up using a spreadsheet.

        For SHA2017, we intend to repeat the success of Logistics at OHM2013.
        We hope to improve upon it, by inviting shift angels to assist us. This
        should allow the LHQ staff to have some time to enjoy the event more,
        and hopefully even allow for sufficient capacity to implement delivery
        to the hard working teams on the rest of the terrain.

Responsibilities

    The subteam has dedicated volunteers, and shift angels. The dedicated
    volunteers who are part of the larger Orga and have been preparing the
    subteam for months in advance of the event, are the Team Leads. Other
    dedicated volunteers have pledged to work at LHQ on site from build-up
    to teardown, or a part of that time frame.

    LHQ is staffed by its dedicated volunteers, assisted by shift angels who do
    2-hour shifts and are not generally available outside the scope of those
    shifts.

Procedures

    Lending items
        Special case: manitous, field forklifts (keys)
            The answer is a friendly 'no'.

            Only our own team members in the On-Site subteam will drive these.

        Special case: other motor vehicle (keys)
            For insurance reasons, only registered and approved drivers may
            use motorized vehicles. This DOES apply to on-site off-road
            vehicles like golf carts!

            Registered drivers are given a wristband for easy identification.

            Drivers must be sober.

            Expected usage under 20 minutes: check if the vehicle's time table
            is clear for at least 30 minutes.

            Expected usage over 20 minutes: request approval from the TeamLead.
            Note that Shuttles, On-site vehicles and Off-site vehicles, each
            have their own subteam.

            Proceed with the 'general case' procedure.

        Special case: radios, batteries
            Radio batteries can be exchanged, but not handed out individually.

            Most radios are reserved for specific teams.

            XXX time table? labels on radios? have ROC people hand out radios
            instead of LHQ desk angels?

        Special case: items not in inventory
            When an item is requested that we don't have, we might still
            be able to help out.

            Ask what the item is needed for; maybe we have something else that
            can be used instead. For example, gaffer tape with permanent marker
            could be an alternative for a label printer; rope could be an
            alternative for tiewraps, or vice versa. Be creative.

            If the item is necessary, but not available, ask if it should be
            bought. In case it needs buying, write down as much information as
            you can get about the volunteer, the product, and what it's needed
            for. We need a way to inform them when we have it. It may take a
            day for us to buy it. If it's urgent, contact a team lead by
            radio.

            Don't make any promises. Buying things costs money and budgets are
            limited.
